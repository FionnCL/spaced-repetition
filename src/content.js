    "introduction1":
        "The <b>goal</b> of the application is to <b>improve a learners ability to pronounce " +
        "words/phrases in an L2</b> by catching any errors in pronunciation that a learner would have otherwise " +
        "initially made. The thought process behind this is that catching such errors as soon as possible will " +
        "will alleviate the problems caused by the <b>fossilization</b> [1] of these mispronunciations " +
        "later in a learners education.",

        "<b>Our proposal:</b> the use of " +
        "<b>Speech Synthesis</b> to help <i>teach</i> the correct pronunciation of a word/phrase " +
        "on spaced repetition flashcard, and <b>Automatic Speech Recognition</b>(ASR) to <i>correct</i> " +

        "Every <i>recall session</i>, a user will be prompted to remember a set of words or phrases from their L1. " +

    "introduction4":
        "After each correct recall, a user will be prompted to sound out each word in order to " +
        "move on to the next stage. This would be our main metric of a learner's increase in performance " +
        "when using the application.",
    "introduction5":
        "<b>Spaced repetition</b> and its positive effects for SLA (among many other disciplines) " +
